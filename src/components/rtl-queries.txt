Qeries are methods that React Testing Library (RTL) provides to find elements on the page

1. To find a single element
    getBy..
    queryBy..
    findBy..

2. To find multiple elements
    getAllBy..
    queryAllBy..
    findAllBy..

The suffix for above methods can be :
- Role                      - DisplayValue
- LabelText                 - AltText
- PlaceholderText           - Title
- Text                      - TestId


getByRole
----------
- Queries for elements with the given role
- By default, many semantic elements in HTML have a role
    * Button element has button role
    * Anchor element: link role
    * h1 to h6 elements: heading role with level
- If an element has no default role or if you want to specify a different role, the role attribute can be used to add the desired role
- getByRole provides various options like
    * name      * selected
    * level     * checked
    * hidden    * pressed

NOTE: <input> with type as number, its role would be spinbutton and not the text


queryBy
--------
- Returns the matching node for a query, and returns null if no element match
- Useful for asserting an element that is not present
- Throws an error if more than one match if found
- queryByAll returns an array of all matching nodes for a query, and returns an empty array if no element match


findBy and findAllBy
--------------------
- Returns a promise which resolves when an element is found which matches the given query
- The promise is rejected if no element is found or if more than one element is found after a default timeout of 1000ms
